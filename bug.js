This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that Expo doesn't support or that's not correctly configured within your project.  It can manifest in different ways, but the core problem is a missing or incompatible module. For example:
```javascript
import { someUnsupportedModule } from 'some-unsupported-module';
```
This might throw an error similar to `Cannot find module 'some-unsupported-module'`, even if the module exists in your `node_modules` directory. Expo's build process might not include the module, or there might be version conflicts.
