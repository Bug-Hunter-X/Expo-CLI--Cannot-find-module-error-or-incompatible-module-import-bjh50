Several solutions exist, depending on the root cause:

1. **Use an Expo-compatible alternative:**  If the module isn't compatible with Expo's managed workflow, look for an alternative that is.  Expo's documentation and the community forum are good resources for finding compatible replacements.

2. **Check module documentation:**  Carefully review the module's documentation for any instructions or requirements for use with Expo. There might be specific configuration steps or dependencies needed for the module to work correctly within an Expo environment.

3. **Install missing native modules (bare workflow):** If you're using Expo's bare workflow, ensure all native modules required by the problematic module are properly installed and linked. 

4. **Correct Import Paths:**  Double-check that all import paths are correct and relative to the location of your file. Incorrect paths can lead to module not found errors. 

**Example (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
// Replace incompatible module with an Expo-compatible one
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser'; // Example

// ...rest of the code
```

Remember to choose the solution that addresses the specific module causing the error.  If you continue facing difficulties, providing the name of the problematic module and a detailed error message will help in diagnosing the issue more precisely.
